      Lee founded his own martial arts philosophy known as Jeet Kune Do — "the way of the intercepting fist" — emphasizing adaptability, efficiency, and freedom from rigid form.
      Beyond his physical prowess, Bruce Lee’s teachings on self-expression, discipline, and personal growth continue to inspire millions worldwide.
